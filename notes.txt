Registration process:

Only apps with a hash in the /apps/whitelist.txt file can register.
Hashes will be written into this file in two ways:

1) start.sh script will check the apps.txt and install the apps in that file
   (Sources can be github://user/repo, file:///path/to/your/app)
   Installation will be the following:
    * download app template in case of github
    * generate hash for app and create app directory with that hash as a name
    * copy template files into app directory
   For every hash in the base app folder an entry in whitelist.txt will be created with
   the postfix ":cyphernode"
     (01234567890123456789012345678912:cyphernode)
   You will be able to register your app calling the registration url

   ( Note: mounts of all apps will be checked to make sure they mount only allowed files
     or their own app folder )

2) add your own external app id u dont want to run inside cyphernode
   edit whitelist.txt and add your app-hash with the postfix ":external"
   Now you will be able to register your app calling the registration
   url
